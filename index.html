                <h3>Our Story</h3>
                <p>I started my first coffee shop in 2004 in Hampstead Garden Suburbs after deciding to give up my 9
                    to 5 job in the city. With no catering experience, the only way I knew how to operate a business
                    was NOT to look at it as a business. I treated it like my home and all the customers were guests
                    in my home.
                    After 13 years, I still stand by the same principle as I have not yet learnt the art of the
                    business but have mastered the art of being a host. We buy the best fresh ingredients and cook
                    the food I serve to my family at home. Everything is freshly cooked on site and served
                    immediately to our guests.</p>
